what i like:
1. the main synth is addictive, i love the chord progression - wonder what plugin they use
2. "i'm so confused" notes D-E-G-A, the note progression going up reflects the natural tone of voice of desperation/anger/frustration
3. the detachment in the chorus, as if addison explains the 

powerful lyrics:
1. "i know you like when i wear this dress / i feel best when I'm wearin' less"
2. "i'm so caught up in my head / wanna take back what I said"
3. "should i jump in the unknown / or is it better to know how it unfolds?"
4. "am I too young to be this mad? / am I too old to blame my dad?"

addison is talking about the trouble of being too young to know yourself while also being old enough that not knowing it is a problem, it's a coming of age song. 
it feels like smudged mascara at 6am after having cried the whole night. the overwhelming feeling of nothingness. it's scary and melancholic. screaming in the car at midnight driving nowhere because this is what you need, you need to focus on driving.

the takeaway / personal reflections
